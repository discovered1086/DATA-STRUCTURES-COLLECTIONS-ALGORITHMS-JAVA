         * 1. Just like Collections class, Arrays class also has the methods sort (with and without comparator)
         * and binarySearch.
         * 2. Seems like the only difference between the binarySearch method in Collections class and the Arrays
         * class is that, unlike the method in the Collections class the method in the Arrays class doesn't need the
         * data structure (array, list) to be already sorted.
         *
         * 3. Here the search for ane element that does NOT exist in the Array returns same result as was the case
         * for binary search for Collections. The only difference is that if we binary search for an element, that does not
         * exist in the array, that has not been sorted, it's still able to return the position where the element should have been,
         * it was present in the array, and that determination seems to be based on the natural ordering of the elements.
