         * This leads me to my final observation on this method
         *
         * 3. The list created out of the array can be modified as long as the size of the list does NOT change. It's really
         * easy to understand why. Arrays are not dynamic data structures. It's size is declared when it's created and the size
         * can't be manipulated on the fly like Collections or Maps.
