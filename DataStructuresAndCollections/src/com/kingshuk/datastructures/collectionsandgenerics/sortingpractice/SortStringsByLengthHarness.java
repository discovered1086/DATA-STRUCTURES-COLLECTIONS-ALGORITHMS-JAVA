         * If the comparator returns 0 for two objects meaning the comparator can't decide between
         * two objects, then the objects natural ordering prevails. The natural ordering comes from
         * the comparable implementation of the object. That's why in this example even though
         * there are some names that have exact same length, there's no problem as the default/natural ordering
         * of strings prevail and they're sorted based on alphabetical order.
         *
         * It's interesting through when comparator compares objects that don't have any default implementation
         * of Comparable or in other words, there's no natural ordering.
