         * The below is the output and it's astonishing
         *
         * The total number of objects in the list are 2400000
         * Found the object in the list....
         * The time taken by the list 26000 ns
         * Found the object in the set....
         * The time taken by the set 0 ns
         *
         * The set takes less than a nano second of time for 2.4 million objects although most of them are duplicates (Only 10 distinct objects
         * meaning 10 distinct hash codes)
         *
         * For the same amount of objects the list takes 26ms to find the object.
         *
         * This proves the theory that the set indeed puts the objects in different buckets (for conceptualization) according to their hashCode.
         * So here even though there are 2.4 million objects, the set only needs to look at 10 buckets of 240000 objects each.
         *
         * So basically when the list has to find the object from 2.4 million objects, the set has to find it from 240,000 objects.
         *
         * If hashCode implementation is missing, the set might take almost the same amount of time. If there are more unique objects, of course
         * the set will take longer
