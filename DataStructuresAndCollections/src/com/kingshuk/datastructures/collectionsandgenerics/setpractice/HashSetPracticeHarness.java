         * There's a lot to talk about here
         * This harness looks simple but it really reflects the importance of equals() and hashCode() method when it comes to HashSet.
         *
         * The Cat implements equals() and hashcode() methods and that's what makes the filtering out of duplicate objects, happen
         * Remember hashCode is used by HashSet to narrow down on the search when it needs to look at duplicates before add any new entry.
         * hashCode helps HashSet put the objects in a bucket labelled with the hashCode let's say.
         *
         * then HashSet calls equals to check if the objects are a perfect match. equals() is what truly identifies one object from another.
         *
         * That's why all objects having same hash code may not be equal but all objects that are equal must have the same hash code
