         *  There's a lot to talk about the IdentityHashMap. Unlike HashMap and LinkedHashMap, it doesn't check
         *  the uniqueness of the key based on the .equals() check, it checks uniqueness based on == comparison
         *
         *  So the below Map is a LinkedHashMap so the first key of 232649 is same as last two keys based on
         *  the .equals() check even though they're different objects. If we use IdentifyHashMap instead, the first key
         *  and the last two keys are not same, as according to == check, they're different objects, something like
         *
         *  Integer key1=new Integer(232649);
         *  Integer key2=new Integer(232649);
         *  Integer key3=new Integer(232649);
         *
         *  Map<Integer, String> employeeMap = new LinkedHashMap<>();
