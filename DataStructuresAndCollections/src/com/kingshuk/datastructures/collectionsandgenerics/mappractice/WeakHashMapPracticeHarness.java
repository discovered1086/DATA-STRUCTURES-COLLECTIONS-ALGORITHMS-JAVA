         * For a HashMap the objects referenced by employee3 and employee4 are still being referenced from the Map
         * So they don't get garbage collected (They're not weak references, they're strong references)
         *
         * For a weak HashMap, the objects being referenced by employee3 and employee4 are garbage collected, even though
         * they're effectively being referenced by the map
         *
         * Elements in a weak HashMap can be reclaimed by the garbage collector if there are no other strong references to the key object,
         * this makes them useful for caches/lookup storage. This is the essence.
